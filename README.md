# ClientServerFactorial

A simple client-server application using socket programming, where the server calculates the factorial of a number sent by the client.

## Features

- **Server**: Receives a number from the client and returns its factorial.
- **Client**: Sends a number to the server and displays the result.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Muhammed-Amer/ClientServerFactorial.git
    cd ClientServerFactorial
    ```

2. Compile the server and client:

    ```bash
    javac FactorialServer.java
    javac FactorialClient.java
    ```

3. Start the server:

    ```bash
    java FactorialServer
    ```

4. In another terminal, run the client:

    ```bash
    java FactorialClient
    ```

5. Enter a number when prompted, and the factorial result will be displayed.

## Learning Outcome

This project helped me explore basic socket programming in Java.
